This document describes the changes between the different revision. There is a previous [OLDER REPO](https://github.com/Electro707/PCB-4-In-A-Row-ARCHIVE) for this project, as mentioned in this repo's [README.md](../README.md)

- PCB rev:
    - V0.9: Initial commit to this repo (used to be known as RevB5 in the previous repo). The reason it's not a 1.0 is because I would to order a test board before releasing the design as complete.
    - V1.0: Initial completed release
- Firmware rev:
    - V0.9: Initial commit to this repo (used to be known as RevB5 in the previous repo). The reason it's not a 1.0 is because I want to test the firmware with the upcomming V1.0 of the board before a 1.0 release.
    - V1.0: Initial completed release
